# IR-Challenge

You’re working as an analyst within a Security Operations Center (SOC). A report comes in from someone stating that a colleague downloaded a questionable file while trying to find a certain software.

After reviewing the initial report, you confirm that the system was compromised. You obtain a packet capture (PCAP) of the network traffic related to the incident. While analyzing the PCAP, you notice indicators of compromise.

Your Investigation Checklist
As part of your incident analysis, address the following points:

- Determine the IP address assigned to that infected device.
- Determine where the file was downloaded from.
- Capture the flag.
- List the attacker's IP.
- Write an incident report of what happened.
